# EasyYTDL_tool

YouTubeDL is a command line tool that can download videos from over 1200 websites. Because it is a command line tool, it is not widely used because most people do not use the command line.  This program has been easy to use without the use of the command line. 

Click on the file: VideoDownloader.zip

This will open a new page with a download Button (right side of page) Click on the download button.  

A zip file called VideoDownloader.zip will download to your computer.  This file is encrypted with a password because some internet browsers say the file is a virus and block the download.  Encryption prevents that from occurring.  

Right click on the VideoDownloader.zip file and click extract files.  A password prompt wil ask for the password. 

When the files are extracted some virus scanners will flag this a virus or malicious program.  When you try to run them the first time Windows will advise against it, this is because the file was downloaded from the internet.  These files do not contain any viruses or malicious programs. There are two files in the folder that can be used to download videos:

VideoDownloader.exe – This will open a small window that allows you to paste the URL where the video is located. Press enter and it will attempt to download it. It should advise you of the status of the download or if an error occurred.

VideoDownloader-All_formats.exe – Does the same thing as VideoDownloader, but will try to download all of the available formats of the video. The formats range anywhere from high definition to mobile formats designed to be played back on small devices.

Copy and paste a URL where the programs directs you to and press enter.  

Examples of where to get URL and what they will look like are as follows:
YouTube – The URL is highlighted in yellow. Just copy (CTR+C or right click copy) and paste (CTR+V or right click paste) into the VideoDownloader prompt. 
 
Twitter – The URL is highlighted in yellow. Twitter can be a bit tricky as not all tweets showing the video will allow a download. The video can often be in another tweet that allows the download.  


Additional Virus/Malicous file warning information.  This YouTubeDL was made by using the python version of this program and creating a Windows EXE file by using PyInstaller.  For some reason a couple of virus scanners do not like this and will flag the file as bad.
